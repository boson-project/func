# Build and test every push to the main branch.
#
# NOTE: Seprate workflows per Branch
# The README contains a build status badge for each of the two primary branches
# main and develop.  However, since the badge does not support unique labels
# (though it does support `?branch`) it appears to the reader as a duplicate
# status badge.  We therefore separate the workflows entirely such that they
# have unique names:  'Main', 'Develop'
